This is a repository for Web Programming (COMP20)


My favorite assignments were both the transit assignment and the score center. Naturally they were also the assignments I am the most proud of and spent the most amount of time on. With the transit assignment, I was excited that we had the opportunity to apply the skills we gained in class to create a useful tool that can be used in the real world. I'm also really glad I had exposure with server-side web development through the score center assignment. Although both were horribly frustrating at times, they allowed me to apply knowledge from lectures in a way that made them sink in.

Prior to taking this class, I knew absolutely nothing about web programming and had just completed intro to CS. Not only have I learned new programming languages, I've also gained a much greater understanding of how the web actually works. I feel like my skills have exponentially improved since day 1. I previously felt very lost and like I was blindly trying to navigate through code. Now I feel more confident that I have a solid enough background to be able to learn more about web programming on my own.
