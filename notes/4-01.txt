April 1 - Databases and Persistent Data Storage


// create new database:
use comp20
show collections;
db.roster.insert({"first_name": "Max", "last_name": "Cohen", "yog": Sophomore})
db.roster.insert({"first_name": "Lisa", "last_name": "Fan", "yog": Sophomore, "Major: CS"})

-can't do relations on different collections
-can add different types of info --- as evidenced by "Major"
-how to update different information? 
	db.roster.update()


db.roster.find({"yog":"Freshman"}) would return nothing since there aren't any..
db.roster.find({"yog":"Sophomore"}) --> full record of all people

-can query by anything
