<!--Introduction - Provide a description of the product and what you were hired to do

Methodology - Describe your methodology pen testing the application, including the tools that you used

Abstract of Findings - Provide an overview of all the security issues you identified. This section should be written for non-technical managers who do not have technical expertise and do not have time to read the entire document. Write this section using lay language.

Issues Found - For each issue that you find, document:

Issue (e.g., database injection, really bad programming practice)

Location / page where issue was found

Severity of issue (e.g., low, medium , or high). Justify your answer.

Description of issue. How did you find it? A screenshot of problem is excellent.

Proof of vulnerability. Screenshots are ideal.

Resolution. How did you resolve the issue? Show code if possible.

Conclusion. You can also list future consdierations and recommendations w/ costs-->

		Assessment conducted by Lucy Qin - 4/24/2014
	</div>
	
	<div>
		<h1>Introduction</h1>
		This report assesses the web security of <a href="http://walton1337.github.io/">Walton Lee's</a> web application, <a href="http://fathomless-reef-4406.herokuapp.com/">2048 Game Center</a>. This web application maintains high scores for the 2048 game developed by Gabby INSERTLASTNAMEs and provides an API to submit and retrieve scores. This report exposes the security weaknesses in the web application and potential vulnerabilities.

	<div>
		<h1>Methodology</h1>
		I began assessing the security of this web application using black box testing. Later I looked at the actual code to find other vulnerabilities.

	<div>
		<h1>Abstract of Findings</h1>
		Inputs are not checked when submitted. This web application relies on users properly putting in the correct input in the correct format. This exposes many vulnerabilities because the user can manipulate the inputs and inject malicious code. The information posted can easily be manipulated and since inputs are not checked, this also allows attackers to search the database and potentially crash it. Since the highest vulnerabilities come from improper checks on inputs, the web application can be made more secure by preventing against such malicious inputs. 
	</div>

	<div>
		<h1>Issues Found</h1>
		<h2>Cross Site Scripting</h2>
		This web application is vulnerable malicious inputs or scripts. The web application currently accepts scripts and HTML tags, this opens up the potential for an attacker to inject malicious code or use javascript to manipulate database contents. Attackers may also be able to access data.
		-Can steal cookies, although the current program doesn't use cookies.
		-Can redirect the site elsewhere

		<h2>Server Crash</h2>
		There is a high potential that users can crash the database. As shown by the screenshot below, the web application currently accepts files. This allows attackers to send exceptionally large files that can quickly fill up the database and crash the application. Can easily overload with

		<h2>Cross Origin Reserouce Sharing</h2>
		The current database allows anyone to post to the web application.

		<h2>HTML Injection</h2>
		The web application currently accepts HTML tags, which allows attackers to change the format of the page. After injecting close tags, the web application no longer displayed the content properly as shown by the screenshot.

		<br>

		<h2>Minor bugs</h2>
		Aside from the vulnerabilities found, there are also some minor bugs in the code. The date did not properly display during my tests. Additionally, scores accepts inputs that are non-numerical as shown by my image below. The code also improperly sorts scores. Scores are sorted in descending order by the first digit only. Therefore my score of 228 was listed before 1252 because of the 2.

<!--
		<h2>Data Extraction</h2>
		The database is not protected against extraction. A user could easily access the database using a query to generate JSON results for all users, except for the one they are querying. 
		Can add additional entries to the database that are not real. Since MongoDB does not require authentication, users can access the database. -->
