Implementation: Index.html contains the report for the security assessment of Walton Lee's 2048 Game Center web application. His web application was attacked multiple times and four main issues were found along with some bugs. The report was then completed with an introduction, methodology, abstract of findings, issues found and conclusion. Styling was later applied to the report. 

Collaboration: I received help during office hours from Tyler Lubeck. I also collaborated briefly with Andrew Jang and received the idea for HTML tag injections from him.

Hours Spent: 15
